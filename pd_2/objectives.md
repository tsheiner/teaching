# Course Overview
Product Design 2 explores the two halves of the product design whole. The first piece is about understanding user needs, defining the design problem, placing it in a context, and exploring solutions. The second part is concerned with turning this understanding into a manufacturable product which responds to today's marketplace. Through lectures, field trips and projects Product Design Two will expose students to the tools they need to control this process from start to finish.
