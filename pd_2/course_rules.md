# Introducing the Hardline

## Attendance
* attendance required for all classes and field trips - gotta be there to get it!
* 3 absences will result in an incomplete
* getting to class 10 minutes after start will get you a persona non grata
* excuses (creative ones) will only be accepted with 24 hr. notices unless your mom or pet gives you a note
## Grades
* evaluation will be based on projects and class participation and how nice you are to those great instructor dudes
* projects are graded by phase so don't try to pull it out the night before
## Feedback
* input from students is crucial to the success of the class
* students are encouraged to question course materials or class events
* students are encouraged to buy instructors lunch in order to question these things
