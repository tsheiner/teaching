the HARDLINE
According to Albert, Tim and the Administration of CCAC
ATTENDANCE
attendance required for all classes and field trips - gotta be there to get it!
3 absence will result in a nasty grade ie. incomplete
getting to class 10 minutes after start will get you a persona non grata
excuses (creative ones) will only be accepted with 24 hr. notices unless your mom or pet gives you a note
GRADES
evaluation will be based on projects and class participation and how nice you are to those great instructor dudes
projects are graded by phase so don't try to pull it out the night before

On the softer side . . .

FEEDBACK
input from students is crucial to the success of the class
students are encouraged to question course materials or class events
students are encouraged to buy instructors lunch in order to question these things
