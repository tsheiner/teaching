**Assignment 2**

**Classification**

**Notes for improvement for next year:**

1. Need to clarify that point of second diagram is to compare the two dimensions, x vs y

2. Need to better explain concept of a standard categorization scheme

3. Need to be clearer about diagram vs poster aspect, possibly require for second diagram that students use markers not images

4. May need to tie this into an interview with an expert

5. Need to adjust rubric to grade for diagram approach

**Introduction**

Classification systems are extremely common, most of us encounter them every day.  Feeling like you need a coffee?  Do you mean an americano, espresso, latte or cappucino?  Do you want that small, medium or large (oh, wait, I mean short, tall, grande or venti) ?  Caffeinated or not?

The interesting thing about classification schemes is that while they are tremendously useful in helping us understand the world, they are arbitrary.  This does not mean they are random, rather that the particular organizational principle that they represent is just one of many that could be chosen.  As a designer, you will come to learn that there is always tremendous meaning in this choice.

**Assignment**

Pick a type of object that exists in the physical world.  The object could be something natural or something man-made.  Examples could be conifers, dogs, the front doors of houses, or types of automobile tires.  Anything that interests you is fine.

1. Take pictures of 10 different instances of this kind of object

2. Organize these 10 instances in terms of 3 different classification schemes 

    1. **Scheme One:** Based on some physical characteristic that you have observed about the object such as color, size, or texture

    2. **Scheme Two:** Based on some measure of value.  Price is an obvious measure, but utility and quality are other common value measures.  Choose a measure of your own devising.

    3. **Scheme Three:** In terms of a some standard scheme used to describe the kind of object you have chosen.  For this one you must find and identify a reference that explains the details of the scheme.  As examples, an acceptable scheme for conifers would be species, for tires would be the P-Metric system.

You will produce 2 artifacts with your collection of images:

1. A single page presentation in which you show your images organized in terms of Scheme One.  

2. Create a single page presentation in which you show your images organized in terms of both Scheme Two and Scheme Three at the same time. 

For both artifacts you decide on the format and how you will use labeling keeping in mind the goal is to make it easy for the viewer to understand the schemes being used.  For the second artifact it is important for the viewer to be able compare the objects in terms of the two schemes and to understand the reference to the standard scheme.

**Resources**

Here are several online articles you can review for ideas about classification:

* http://www.uxbooth.com/blog/classification-schemes-and-when-to-use-them/

* http://semanticstudios.com/publications/semantics/000003.php

* http://www.uie.com/articles/faceted_search/

* http://www.alistapart.com/articles/design-patterns-faceted-navigation/

**Submission**

On the day the assignment is due, bring tabloid sized output of both your artifacts and be prepared to spend no more than 5 minutes explaining them to the class.  

In addition to the in-class presentation, submit a single PDF document that contains both artifacts. 

**Grading Rubric**

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Quality</td>
    <td>Poor (1)</td>
    <td>Good (2-3)</td>
    <td>Excellent (4)</td>
    <td>Weight (%)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Content & Imagery</td>
    <td>The instances are not unique or not clearly related or the image quality is poor </td>
    <td>The instances are clearly distinct members of a set and the images display them to good advantage</td>
    <td>The images are beautiful and highlight the particular distinctions between the instances represented or use charm, whimsy or some other method to communicate the essence of the objects</td>
    <td>20%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Graphic Design</td>
    <td>Layout, labeling or organization is poor and the presentation is visually unattractive or inappropriate to the intended meaning</td>
    <td>The relationship between the objects and the classification schemes is clear, the labeling is easy to understand and the overall effect is pleasing</td>
    <td>The presentation is extremely attractive and the use of graphical techniques and layout is particularly appropriate for displaying the objects in terms of the classification schemes</td>
    <td>30%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Analytic Utility</td>
    <td>The classification schemes do not make sense for the chosen set or the set is not well-organized within the schemes or it is difficult to compare objects in terms of the schemes</td>
    <td>The selected schemes and the chosen objects are a good match and the presentation works as a tool for understanding distinctions between object instances</td>
    <td>The presentation communicates its meaning in a particularly clever way that helps the viewer understand the depicted objects in a new and original way</td>
    <td>50%</td>
