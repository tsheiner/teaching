**Assignment 4**

**Workflows**

**Notes for improvement:**

* **Need to be clearer that want 1 page per step in presentation**

* **Rubric needs to better distinguish between the analysis of the workflows and the way they are presented**

**Introduction**

Software applications exist to enable people to do things.  Most applications actually permit people to do a collection of related things all in the service of achieving some larger goal.  These things are called workflows.  An important part of designing software for complex problems is being able to think in terms of workflows.     

**Assignment**

Choose an online content creation application such as Gmail, Google Docs, Facebook, Twitter, or Tumblr.

Find an example of 3 of the following types of workflows: 

1. authentication

2. content creation

3. content organization

4. sharing

5. permission management

6. configuration management

Represent each of the three workflows in **two** different ways.  

1. Capture each screen the user sees in completing the workflow and organize them into a linear sequence, with each screen labeled in terms of the step it represents. 

2. Create a single page process diagram where there is a 1:1 relationship between the screens you collected and the steps represented in your flow diagram.  Be sure to represent any feedback loops you find.  

**Pay attention to the labels you apply to each step and make sure that they are consistent between your diagram and the sequential presentation.**

**Submission**

Your submission will be a linear sequence like a slide show.  It must have all of the following pieces:

1. title slide

    1. Title that includes the name of the application you analyzed

    2. Your name

    3. Assignment name

    4. Date

2. table of content slide, listing the three workflows youâ€™ve selected

3. section title for first workflow

    5. Name of workflow

    6. Short description of workflow, identifying purpose, start and end points

4. diagram of workflow

5. screens of workflow, as many as required to match steps in diagram of workflow

6. repeat 3-5 two more times for other workflows you have analyzed

During class you will share just one of these sequences with us, starting with the title slide and ending with the last slide in the sequence.  You will submit your full slide show as a PDF to Coursekit by 9 am the day the assignment is due.

**Discussion & Resources**

The purpose of this assignment is to practice thinking about an software experience as a collection of related workflows which themselves consist of discrete steps and feedback loops.  

Workflows are a kind of system.  LIke all systems, there are no clear rules for establishing the boundaries of a workflow.  Instead you must look for clues like the observation that some object has been transformed, or a transaction has completed.  In general, most software workflows consists of 3-5 steps or screens.  If you find yourself with much more than that for a given workflow, consider breaking it into two separate pieces.

While this kind of flow-based thinking is implicit in the common technique of using static wireframes to describe an experience design, I was able to find surprisingly few articles online that offered insight into the process of analyzing applications in terms of flow.  Here are a few I found interesting, though they are mostly written from the perspective of building flows that drive user conversion.

    <td>The workflows address the areas requested, they are complete, there is good alignment between the schematics and the screen by screen views and the labeling communicates well</td>
    <td>The analysis exceeds expectations in some way by either showing relationships between the workflows, elucidating the role of feedback in the workflows or revealing some insight regarding the design of the application</td>
