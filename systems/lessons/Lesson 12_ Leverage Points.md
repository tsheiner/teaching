# Reading Assignment

# Submission

Please answer each of the following questions with a few sentences.  Each question is worth two points.

1. In this chapter Meadows paraphrases her teacher, and systems thinking pioneer, Jay Forrester in describing that while people involved in a system know where the leverage points are, they often push them in the wrong direction for the change they want to cause.  How do you account for this observation?

2. Consider the content of this chapter in the context of your final project for this class.  What are some of your initial thoughts about the leverage points, and how to push on them, to cause positive change in the system you are working on in this project?
