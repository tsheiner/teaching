Systems Syllabus

# Course Overview

In a world where data resides in the cloud and access is achieved with various devices used in different contexts, designing in terms of systems is a crucial part of delivering useful and compelling user experiences. However, the value of a systems approach to interaction design problems goes much deeper than the current networked world in which we live and gets at the essential nature of interactivity, communication and information itself. This course will introduce you to classical system theory, explore its application to user experience design and provide you with practice with tools for prototyping and sharing your ideas.

# Learning Objectives

1. Gain an understanding of the basic concepts and vocabulary of classical system theory and how it can be applied to real world situations through models.

2. Learn to apply system concepts to the design of software experiences through a specific modeling framework, The Digital Machine.

3. Develop skills for communicating system thinking concepts through diagrams, wireframes and software prototypes.

# Grading Policy

There will be 100 points possible in the class distributed across lessons, projects and participation evaluations.  While all grading necessarily contains some degree of subjectivity, it is our intention is to make the process as transparent as possible and so we will include a detailed evaluation rubric with all lessons and project briefs.

## Lessons - 30 points

Lessons are standalone deliverables intended to teach you a particular aspect of system design.  There will be 10 lessons, each worth 3 points.  

## Term Project - 50 points

The term project, delivered in two graded phases, each of approximately one month duration, will require you to synthesize a variety of system design skills and concepts.  The deliverables for each phase will be worth 25 points. 

## Participation - 20 points

Your participation grade is made up of two parts.  The first is to do with in-class participation. While this is a studio class, there will be treatment of theory, communicated through readings, lectures and in-class discussion.  Readings must be completed **before** the class in which they will be discussed.  

Class participation will be scored according to this rubric:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Dimension</td>
    <td>Pass (1)</td>
    <td>Fail (0)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Attendance</td>
    <td>Student is always on time.</td>
    <td>Student is frequently tardy</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Preparation</td>
    <td>Student has reviewed the assigned material and made a reasonable effort to synthesize it</td>
    <td>Student has not prepared the material or prepared to the most cursory degree</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Attitude</td>
    <td>Student is enthusiastic and fully engaged and positive</td>
    <td>Student is frequently sullen, sarcastic or otherwise negative </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Collaboration</td>
    <td>Student is inclusive, collaborative and seeks to encourage the same in others</td>
    <td>Student is exclusive, reluctant to help others or actively undermines others</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Discusion</td>
    <td>Student contributes to class discussion with questions, opinions and observations</td>
    <td>Student rarely if ever speaks up in class discussion</td>
  </tr>
</table>

# Required Course Materials

* Tom Stoppard, Arcadia

* Donella Meadows, Thinking in Systems

* Peter Checkland & John Poulter, Learning for Action

# Attendance Policy

Students must be present in the classroom for the entire class period for each scheduled meeting of the semester in order to meet the class learning objectives. Class will include discussions, critiques, lectures, and other learning activities. Students are expected to arrive on-time and remain present for the entire period scheduled.

Records of attendance and tardiness will be kept for each class. Three unexcused absences will result in a failing grade for the class. Being late three time (more than 5 minutes) will be treated as equivalent to one unexcused absence. 

You are expected to inform your instructor of any absence before the start of the class you will miss. Excused absences will be granted only in the case of personal illness or a family emergency.  Any other type of absence, even if pre-notified, will not be excused. Missing class does not excuse you from completing any of the assignments due for that class.
