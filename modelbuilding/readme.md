# What is this?

This is an introductory modelmaking course aimed at product designers that I created in 1996 as INDU-0047 for the undergraduate product design program at Califonia College of Arts and Crafts (now California College of Art).

# Background

In 1996 I was hired at California College of Arts & Crafts (now California College of Art) to develop a modelmaking course for the undergraduate Product Design program. Thinking about it now (2023) I think the reason why the Product Design program did not already have a modelmaking course was that it was also new. This was all happening right at the same time as the college was opening the San Francisco campus and so I think that creating a formal, separate, Product Design program was itself a new initiative, done as part of opening the new campus.

Accepting this gig was a bit of hedge on my part. Professionally at that time I had made a commitment to migrate my design career from physical product design to software, specifically software for the World Wide Web. However, hard as it is to imagine now, even though I was pretty sure this bet would pay off, it was something of a risky move because there was still a lot of question as to whether the WWW was real or hype and if it could support a design career. So, to some extent, taking the job to develop this course was a chance to make some last minute money from the physical product design world I was planning to walk away from while also keeping my hand in a bit and maintaing my contacts with it in case the whole virtual thing did not pan out.

In any case, I attacked the project with my standard-level serious intensity, excited to structure, formalize and document all that I knew about making the models and prototypes that were an essential part of the physical product design process. What this meant was that in addition to developing a curriculum and set of assignments I also undertook the self-imposed task of writing detailed handouts describing all my knowledge, tips and tricks for each of the separate skills (e.g. drawing, working with paper, foamcore, foam, etc) I thought were essential to master to build models. 

In retrospect doing all this work was kind of nuts (and particularly so given I only taught the class once!) but at the time it just felt like something my students needed me to do and so I didn't think twice about it. It wasn't until the very end of the semester that two things happened that opened my eyes to the fact I'd done something unusual in developing the skills handouts. The first was a conversation with one of my students where he thanked me for the handouts, and as started to demur modestly, he grabbed my arm, looked me straight in the eyes and said "you don't understand, no other teacher would do this!" That certainly got my attention. The second thing was that on the last day of class, as I was setting up for the goodbye party, I got called into the office of the head of the Product Design program, [Steven Skov Holt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Skov_Holt), who was absolutely furious at me because he'd just gotten an enormous bill from the internal copying department for all handouts I'd had made!

In honor of this history, and some personal vanity, after keeping the files of this work around for 27 years, I finally undertook to convert the archaic formats (QuarkXpress and EPS) into markdown and SVG and open source the content.
