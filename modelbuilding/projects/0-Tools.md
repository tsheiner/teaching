# Project 0: Tools

The following list of tools covers the basic equipment you will need to complete the assignments in this course.  The list may seem long, but if you are serious about pursuing this course and an education in industrial design you will need all these tools.  While the initial investment is steep, viewing it as a cost you will amortize over the length of your schooling (and career) may soften the blow somewhat.

In choosing your tools you will often be presented with a variety of products in each category.   Which to choose is a personal matter, but my advice is this: base your decision on quality, not cost.  Inferior tools waste time, cause frustration, and deflect the focus from the work to the tool.  However, while cost is often an accurate indicator of quality, the most expensive product is not always the right choice.  Consider the design, the use of materials, and whether the features are relevant to your actual needs.  Tools are a lot like friends: if chosen well they will last a long time and bring you much joy.
