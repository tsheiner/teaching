# Project 2: Cube

#### Brief Phase One: 

Make a cube 3” on a side.

#### Phase Two: 

Color your cube.  The color scheme is of your choosing, however you must adhere to the following guidelines.

1. Use at least 3 colors in addition to the base color of the foamcore.
1. Do not cover all of the foamcore.
1. In addition to the base color, 2 of your colors must be contiguous on at least 3 of the faces of the cube.

#### Goals 
The goal of this project is gain an understanding of the strengths and limitations of foamcore.  In addition, this project introduces some of the issues involved in adding color to a three-dimensional object.  You are urged to experiment.  Try different methods for constructing the cube and for coloring it.  

#### Materials 
For the cube you are restricted to using foamcore.  You may use any thickness of foamcore you wish, but I recommend 3/16 inch.  You may color the cube with whatever medium you fancy.

Bring at least one completed cube.  I would appreciate seeing your experiments as well.

#### Format

Again, this project will not receive a letter grade but will form part of your class participation #### Evaluation grade.  Experiment.  The more learning you do now, the less you will have to do later.
