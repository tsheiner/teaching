# Project 5: House 

#### Brief 
Develop working drawings for and then make a model of a house.  House means the dwelling place of a single family, extended or nuclear.  This definition excludes any kind of multiple or communal dwelling like an apartment building, dormitory, or cluster project.  You are welcome to build a house from any culture or region as long as it is a single family dwelling.

#### Goals 
One of the goals of this project is that you continue to learn about the relationship between the two-dimensional representation of an object and its three-dimensional reality.  Another is that you appreciate the importance of understanding scale in building successful models.  Finally, this project will require that you begin to consider context as an integral part of your models. 

You may use any materials you wish.

#### Materials

This project consists of two discreet deliverables.  The first, due at the beginning of class 21 October, is a set of dimensioned, working drawings from which you will build your model.  The drawings needn’t be done on the computer, but they must be neat, legible, and include a title block.

#### Format 

You will create these drawings by first finding a photograph of a house and developing drawings from that example.  You are free to improvise elevations that are not shown in your photograph and you may extract or simplify the design.  Because you will need to work on your model before I have completed grading the drawings, keep your originals and give me a copy, including a copy of your example photo.    

The second deliverable is the model itself, due a week after the drawings on 28 October.  You will have to decide what is the appropriate level of detail to render, but your goal should be that an observer be able to create a clear mental picture of the house after viewing your model.  Do not model the interior of the house; this is not a “top-off” model.  At the presentation you must display your example photograph for comparison.    

In addition to the house itself your model must indicate the context in which your house would be found.  You do not need to create a complete landscape, but provide sufficient clues so that an observer can easily understand the context.  

The dimensions of your base must be exactly 18” x 24.”  You may choose whatever scale you wish for your model, but the footprint of your model house must be a minimum of 30% and a maximum of 60% of the area of the base.

This is your first graded project.  The drawings will be weighted one third; the model, two thirds.  

#### Evaluation 
I will grade the drawings based on how easily I could use them to build a model and how you have chosen to interpret your example photograph.  

I will grade your model based on how well it translates the photo into three-dimensional form.  I will pay particular attention to the materials you choose to model the elements of your house and the scale relationship between the different components.
