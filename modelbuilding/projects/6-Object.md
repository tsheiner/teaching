# Project 6: Object

#### Brief 
Create an accurate reproduction of the everyday object of your choice.  Your model must be at 1:1 scale, and as realistic as possible.  It will be an appearance model, and need not function nor have any moving parts.  

You will, however, need to turn in three copies of the model.  These copies will be taken to different levels of finish.  One will be just the parts of the model, unassembled.  Two will be assembled but unfinished, and three will be assembled and finished.  

This project will be organized into three phases.  In phase one you will learn about the object you have chosen.  In phase two you will plan the production of your model, and in phase three you will produce multiple copies of your model.

#### Goals 
One goal of this project is that you think about the details which make something look “real.”  

The other is that, because of the multiple copy requirement, you will concentrate on your process as much as your result.  

#### Materials 
You may use any materials you wish.  However, my expectation is that this project will result in an appearance-type model so you should choose materials that are appropriate for that level of quality.

#### Format 
##### Phase One

Choose an subject to model.  Because you will need to make multiple copies of your model, you should choose a very simple, hand-sized object.  Reasonable examples include a hair dryer, shampoo bottle, door knob, lightbulb, or a banana.  This is not an exhaustive list. 

Explore and document different incarnations of the object you have chosen.  Your goal is to understand which details which will be essential to making your model look real.  On 11 November each of you will give a 5 minute presentations describing the object you have chosen and explaining what you believe will be crucial to creating a successful model.  Slides would be an effective presentation technique but are not required.

##### Phase Two

Plan the production of your model.  You will need to hand in three things.  A project schedule will list the major activities involved in creating the model, such as buying materials, getting advice and making drawings, and the dates when you will do those things.  A budget will detail all the steps involved in planning and making the model and give an estimate as to how much time each step will take, in hours.  Finally, an operation sequence will list, in the order you plan to perform them, the specific manufacturing steps involved in making your model.   

##### Phase Three

Build three copies of your model.  In order to make multiple copies you will probably need to build jigs to make your parts.  Do not forget to budget time for doing this.  Also, producing a careful finish takes a long time.  Budget at least as much time for this process as for all the other steps combined.

#### Evaluation 
Phases one and two will each be worth one 1/5 and phase three will be worth 3/5 of the grade for this project.  My criteria for phase one will be how carefully you have tried to understand your object.  In phase two I will grade based on how thoroughly you have planned your process and how well you have organized your documentation.  The grade for phase three will reflect your choice of materials, your commitment to process and, of course, the quality of your models.

**Final note:** you must bring all three of your models in some kind of box or case so that I can transport them without damaging them.
