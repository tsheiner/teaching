# Project 1: Collage

#### Brief 
Your first assignment is to make a collage of cut paper.  The subject of the collage is up to you, but it must have both a subject and a title.  Possible subjects are a personal statement, depiction of an emotion, a political statement, or what I did on my summer vacation.

#### Goals 
While the bulk of this course will be devoted to creating three dimensional objects, this project is two dimensional.  One reason for this is to introduce basic cutting and gluing techniques that will be useful as we move into more structural materials.  A second, and perhaps more important, reason is that a technically simple project will allow us to focus on a number of subjective issues involved in creating successful models such as neatness, cleanliness, care, organization and attention to detail.

#### Materials 
You may use as your raw material any paper you can find.  Try a variety of different kinds and textures.  Newspapers, magazines, and books are obvious resources for images and text.  Experiment with both black and white and color copies.  Consider using photos, negatives, and other forms of transparencies.   Pay attention to scale, color and contrast.

You are required to include at least a fragment of the following two elements in your collage.  The first is pantone paper.  The second is a pencil sketch drawn by you.

#### Format 
Your collage must be mounted on white illustration board.   The dimensions of the board must be 18” x 24.”  How much of that space is filled with your collage is up to you, however you must leave some border on all four sides.  Your name and the title of your collage must appear, distinct from the collage itself, in the lower left hand corner of this border.  

Although scanners and digital imaging software permits the creation of fascinating, beautiful and artistic collages which may then be output by a variety of means, the manipulation of digital images is not the point of this assignment.  Please restrict your work to choosing, cutting, and gluing paper.

#### Evaluation

This project will not receive a letter grade but will form part of your class participation grade. Hopefully, you will see this as a risk-free opportunity to explore and experiment.  From the point of view of design, this will be the most open-ended project you will have in this class.  Have fun with it.
