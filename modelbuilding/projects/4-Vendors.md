# Project 4: Vendors

#### Brief 
Identify two local vendors for each of the items or categories listed below.  Produce a list of the vendors you have found.  

#### Goals 
Although designers are seen by the public as formgivers, the unglamourous truth about the profession is that much of our time is actually spent locating materials.  Occasionally it will be raw materials or custom parts but more often it will be standard materials or pre-manufactured sub- assemblies.  In either case access to reliable, knowledgeable and well-stocked vendors is an in- valuable part of the design process.

The goals of this project are that you find vendors for materials you may need in this course and that you become comfortable with the process of locating these vendors.  The information will serve you this semester; the experience will be useful throughout your career.

#### Format
Your list must be printed neatly.  It must have some organizational structure such as alphabetical, by material type, or whatever you feel is most useful.  Include the name, address, and phone number and type of product sold for each vendor.  I suggest you include a comments section for each vendor where you can note their specialities, minimum orders, or other individually relevant information. 

For those of you that have access to some kind of database software, it would be an excellent idea to create your list using this software.  I will still require that you hand in a hardcopy of your list, so be sure to create a layout suitable for printing.
