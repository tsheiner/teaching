# Summary of the Skills Handouts

#### Drawing Skills
This document is about creating drawings that help you build models. My intention is to highlight a few concepts and techniques that I think are important. My discussion assumes an understanding of basic drafting skills, perspective, and light and shadow.

#### Paper Skills
This handout deals with techniques relevant to the creation of two dimensional projects using materials like paper, card stock, illustration board, and foamcore.  While some of these materials can be used to create three dimensional structures, techniques for doing so are beyond the scope of this document.

#### Foamcore Skills
This handout describes techniques for creating structures with foamcore.  This document will refer to techniques described in the paper skills handout.

#### Foam Skills
This document treats methods for making models from structural foam.  In addition to hand techniques, some power tools will be introduced.

#### Plastic Skills
This handout introduces plastic as a modelmaking material.  I will discuss the characteristics of some of the most common plastics, but most of the handout will be directed towards working with acrylic.  I will also introduce a few new power tools and the topic of threaded fasteners. 

#### Filler Skills
This handout discusses how to apply body fillers and glazing putty.  These materials are used after the parts of your model have been assembled, but before the model is painted.  With them you can fix mistakes, smooth surfaces and add features like fillets.

#### Solvent Skills
This document is intended as a brief description of the common solvents you will run across in making models and working around the shop.  It is based solely on my experience;  I have not looked at the MSDSs for or researched the chemistry of the various solvents.

#### Finishing Skills
This handout is focuses on painting plastic and foam, but explains a systematic approach to finishing which is relevant to other applications such as furniture or polishing metal.  I will discuss the necessary materials, move on to general issues, and then describe the specific steps in the process.  The emphasis of the method described is that finishing is a process of constructing a surface made of paint rather than simply painting the surface of your model.  

#### Good Fit Skills
This document is not about how to build models, but what model to build.  The good fit we will be discussing is a contextual one, not a mechanical one.  It may seem like overkill to raise what is essentially an intellectual issue in the context of a skills-based class.  However, a common mistake I see students make is not using their models as the powerful design tools that they can be.  I will try to present here a framework for deciding, in a given situation, what sort of a model to make, how much energy to expend, and what results to expect.  

#### Planning Skills
This document is about project management.  Even the simplest model building project involves, at least implicitly, a management component.  I will discuss tools for planning a project, followed by the contexts which define a project.  Finally, I will describe the essential elements of a project which must be organized.  This may seem a bit involved for a simple model, but the process I describe can be scaled appropriately for large or small projects.
