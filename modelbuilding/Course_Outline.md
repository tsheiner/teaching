# Modelbuilding Course Outline 

**Objective** 
The goal for this course is to learn how to express ideas in three dimensions.  We will discuss a variety of materials and the techniques appropriate for manipulating these materials.  Our con- centration will be on fabrication but we will address some of the subjective issues involved in modelmaking such as quality, appropriateness and versimilitude.  Although design issues and design process will form part of the discussion, this is a skills class, not a design class.    

**Format** 
This course will be taught in studio.  Each class will generally be divided in half with the first part devoted to discussion and demonstrations and the second half for work and individual instruction.  Some days will be devoted wholly to instruction, presentation or work.  There will be several guest lectures as well as two field trips.  The class syllabus has more details.

There will be six assignments for this course.  The first four will be graded on a participation basis only; the last two will receive letter grades.

**Grading**

The grading for the course will be based on the following calculus.

* Participation & Projects 1 through 4 = 30% 
* Project 5 = 30%
* Project 6 = 40%

No late work will be accepted.
